    <h2>Description of IPs</h2>
    <p> IP, which stands for Internet Protocol, is a set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over the internet.
      An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network that uses the Internet Protocol, such as a computer, smartphone, or router.
      There are two versions of IP currently in use: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, and it is the most commonly used version of IP. IPv6, on the other hand, uses 128-bit addresses, which allows for a much larger number of possible unique addresses.
      IP addresses are typically represented in dotted decimal notation, where each group of numbers separated by a dot represents one byte of the address. For example, an IPv4 address might look like this: 192.168.1.2.
      IP addresses are used to identify the source and destination of data packets that are transmitted over the internet. When a device sends data to another device, it attaches the destination IP address to the packet so that the network knows where to send it. Similarly, when data is received, the source IP address is used to identify the sender of the data.
      IP addresses are an essential part of the internet infrastructure, and they are used in a wide range of applications, from simple web browsing to complex network communication protocols.

    <h2>Basic features and capabilities provided by IPs</h2>
    <p>
      There are many functions and capabilities of IP addresses. Some basic features include:
      <ul>
        <li>Every device on a network that uses the Internet Protocol has a unique IP address, which identifies it on the network.</li>
        <li>IP addresses are used to route data packets from one device to another across a network, ensuring that data is sent to the correct destination.</li>
        <li>IP comes in different versions, such as IPv4 and IPv6, which use different address formats and have different capabilities.</li>
        <li>The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to translate human-readable domain names (such as cnn.com) into IP addresses that can be used by devices to connect to servers.</li>
        <li>IP packets contain header information, which includes information such as the source and destination IP addresses, the packet length, and the type of data contained in the packet.</li>
        <li>IP can be used together with other protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), to provide secure communication over a network.</li>
      </ul>
       </p>

    <h2>Contributions of IPs to the internet community</h2>
    <p> IPs have a made a huge impact on the internet community. They have made it possible for devices to communicate and exchange data across networks, enabling global communication and collaboration on an unprecedented scale. In addition, they have been used to support a wide range of new technologies, such as VoIP, streaming video, and cloud computing, which have transformed the way we work, learn, and communicate. <br> <br>
      
      The open nature of IPs have driven innovation by allowing developers to create new applications and services that run over the internet, such as social media, online marketplaces, and mobile apps. Furthermore, they provide a standard framework for communication and data exchange, allowing devices and applications from different vendors and manufacturers to work together seamlessly. IP have also made it possible to conduct business transactions over the internet, which has led to the development of e-commerce and online marketplaces.

    <h2>Simplified history of IPs</h2>
    <p> 
      The history of IPs (Internet Protocols) dates back to the late 1960s and early 1970s when the U.S. Department of Defense was developing a computer network called the ARPANET. In the early days of the ARPANET, communication between computers was based on a protocol called the Network Control Program (NCP). However, as the network grew and more computers were added, it became clear that a more scalable and flexible protocol was needed. 
      In the late 1970s, a team of researchers at the U.S. Department of Defense, led by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, began work on a new protocol that would become the foundation for the modern internet. This protocol, which they called the Internet Protocol (IP), was designed to enable communication between networks, rather than just between individual computers.
      The first version of IP, called IPv4, was standardized in the early 1980s and quickly became the dominant protocol used on the internet. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses and can support up to 4.3 billion unique addresses.
      As the internet continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s, it became clear that IPv4's address space was insufficient to support the number of devices and users that needed to be connected.<br><br> To address this issue, a new version of IP, called IPv6, was developed in the late 1990s. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses and can support up to 340 undecillion unique addresses, ensuring that the internet can continue to grow and evolve for many years to come.

    <h2>Pertinent RFC's for IPs</h2>
    <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>RFC 791 defines the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which is the most widely used version of IP. It specifies the format of IPv4 packets, including the header and data fields, and defines how packets should be forwarded across networks.</li>
        <li>RFC 2460 defines the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which is the latest version of IP. It specifies the format of IPv6 packets, including the header and data fields, and defines how packets should be forwarded across networks.</li>
        <li>RFC 792 defines the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which is used by devices to communicate error messages and operational information related to IP.</li>
      </ul>
